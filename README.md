# Parallel

This repository contains various parallel programming samples. It is a mashup of code in various
languages that use various parallel programming techniques. I use this repository as a sandbox
for experimentation. The quality of the code is highly variable, although I'd like to think
there is a tendency for it to converge toward higher quality!
