# Parallel

This repository contains various parallel programming experiments. It is a mixup of code in
various languages that use various parallel programming techniques. I use this repository as a
test bed and self-educational platform. The quality of the code is highly variable, although I
hope there is a tendency for it to converge on better examples!
