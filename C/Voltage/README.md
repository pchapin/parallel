Voltage Fields
==============

This program uses Gauss-Seidel iteration to compute the voltage field between several charged
plates (that are held at a constant voltage). This program is 2-dimensional. A future version
might also compute electric field strength and estimate the maximum voltage that can be applied
to the plates before breakdown (and arcing) occurs.
