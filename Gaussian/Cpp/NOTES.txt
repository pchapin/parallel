solve_system.f95
linear_equations.f95

   These two files contain a sample program from "Fortran 90 Programming" that solves a system
   of simultaneous equations using Gaussian elimination. The performance of this program should
   be compared to my C translation (below).

   Notice that to get good performance it is necessary to exchange the array indicies in the
   matrix of coefficients relative to the C version. Notice also that using Fortran
   assumed-shape arrays reduced the performance of the program (with Compaq Fortran v5.5).

solve_system.cpp
linear_equations.hpp
linear_equationsp.hpp
Matrix.hpp

   These files contain the C++ translation of the program above. The file linear_equations.hpp
   contains the sequential solution and the file linear_equationsp.hpp contains the parallel
   solution using a ThreadPool object to help reduce thread management overhead.

linear_equations-single-threaded.c
linear_equations-multi-threaded.c
linear_equations-barriers.c

   These three files represent parallel versions of the above program, written in C99 and using
   POSIX thread primitives. The first file is the serial version of the program that can be used
   as a baseline. The second file creates and joins with threads for each pass of the main loop.
   The third file uses barriers to coordinate thread activity. In theory the barrier version
   should have less overhead and thus be faster. In practice how true this is will depend on
   various factors (such as the size of the system being solved).

linear_equations.ads
linear_equations.adb
solve_system.adb

   This is an Ada translation of the program using tasks for parallelism.

The Fortran version of this program outperformed the C version by 5% computationally on midnight
(466 MHz Alpha EV6 running Tru64 Unix v5.1A; Compaq C v6.4 and Compaq Fortran v5.5 both with
full optimization options). The Fortran I/O performance was about 1/2 that of the C version.
